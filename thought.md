+ current problems
  + after first pop, it just continues to pop same popped elements
  + need way to copy default, then store new in one variable (can't create infinetly many variables if you have a ∞ by ∞ matrix)

Todo: </br>
+ generalizing matrix class </br>
  + ~~add~~
  + ~~scalar~~
  + ~~dot~~
  + ~~transpose~~
  + ~~multiplication~~
+ recursive det
  + ~~get standard det working~~
  + get sub matrix helper function working
  + get recursion working
+ to work with matrix class instead of array
  + ~~add~~ 
  + ~~transpose~~
  + ~~scalar~~
  + ~~matrix multiplication~~ </br>
